					<h3 class="mb-4">Vision</h3>
					<p>Recently, I visited the ‘Museum of Ancient Greek Technology’ in Athens. The inventions of the Ancient Greeks are marvellous to behold and often rely on a combination of mechanical and hydraulic principles to create self-operating clocks, automatic whistling doorbells, but also early robot servants and a magically moving theatre through mechanical pre-programming [1]. Behind the curtains operate relatively easy to understand, tangible mechanisms that either generate knowledge on natural processes or employ principles as seen in nature for both functional and aesthetic purposes. I find it wonderful that by one museum visit and understanding just a few principles, one can start imagining the design of a broad spectrum of tangible systems with accessible materials that have a variety of complexity and output.</p>  
					<p>Novel technological advancements show the development and societal integration of machines that can do increasingly more and complex tasks. A well-known example is the robot dog of Boston Dynamics, called ‘Spot’, which current implementation is mostly in factories to transport objects or check the quality of products [2], [3]. These developments are impressive; however, they often rely on a vast amount of training data and bulky, specialized electronic components. Furthermore, ‘Spot’ shares physical similarities with dogs, which aims to support its integration into human filled factories due to humans’ familiarity with dogs [3]. However, the metal and plastic designed robot does not detect touch, therefore Spot’s interactions with its environment and the human actors within it is vastly different compared to those of its natural counterpart. Recent studies in research are therefore investigating the incorporation of dynamic materials in machines that allow for richer interactions with their environment [4], [5], [6].</p> 
					<p><b>Here lies the question, how do we want to approach further development of these machines and materials? Which strategies for designing such systems are there and how do they add value to the generation of new knowledge? </b></p> 
					<p><b>I believe that the generation of knowledge for increasingly intelligent machines and novel dynamic materials should involve the expansion of our understanding of complex natural processes and systems. The developed artificial systems should take inspiration from nature and strive for increased accessibility and exploration in use. Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary collaborations should be the drivers behind novel technologies and allow for reflection on societal relevance and needs within machine and material development.</b></p> 
					<p>I believe one such field where this vision is being implemented is soft robotics. The word ‘soft’ comes from incorporating “soft materials similar to what is found in nature” [7] or structures that are “…primarily composed of materials with moduli in the range of that of soft biological materials” [8]. The research is driven by translating elements from natural systems into the design of soft robots that allow for increased adaptability in interaction with their environment [7], [8]. This ranges from the development of dynamic materials to incorporate sensing into the physical body itself [6], [9], to the development of systems that are driven by mechanics and/or hydraulics to control the movement of soft robots[4], [10], [11], [12], similar what we have seen in inventions by the Ancient Greeks. I believe the research done within the field of soft robotics is one of the contributors and frontiers to the earlier mentioned innovations for increasingly intelligent machines and integration of novel dynamic materials. Innovations such as the design of soft robots contribute to the creation of intuition in designing, setting up inter- and transdisciplinary collaborations and increasing understanding of natural systems as I believe innovation of technology should advance towards.</p>

					<h3 class="mb-4">Identity</h3>
					<p>One of my earliest inspirations in the field of design was the interactive art sculpture ‘CLOUD’ by Caitlind R.C. Brown & Wayne Garret [13]. The tangible interaction with the sculpture and the collaboration with other people to dynamically change the state of the sculpture showed me the value of playfulness and exploration in design. During my Final Bachelor Project and start of my master Industrial Design (ID), I was mainly inspired by the work of Neri Oxman on 3D printing with biomaterials [14] and interactive, shape-changing interfaces such as ‘Ripple Thermostat’ [15]. The former showed me the value of nature informed design for the development of novel materials and manufacturing techniques. The latter showed how meaningful interactions are created through the design of dynamic interfaces. Driven by the desire to learn more about manufacturing processes, dynamic material and system design, I followed courses at ID, Mechanical Engineering (ME) and Chemical Engineering (CE). Here I got introduced to the interdisciplinary field of soft robotics. It broadened my view on the meaning of intelligence, that it does not solely come from (language-based) algorithms, but is something that emerges through brain-body-environment interactions as seen in nature. The soft robotics field shaped my current vision by exposing me to a whole new world of nature informed design and made the development of machines/robots much more accessible and intuitive to me. Since then, my personal development and main inspiration focus on the design and technical knowledge on dynamic (robotic) systems and interfaces from an interdisciplinary perspective.</p>
					<p>The common denominator in my personal development and interests is the design of (interactive) tangible products and systems. For me, learning through doing and making is the most accessible method to create intuition, obtain new skills and generate knowledge. In most of my projects, I therefore lean towards applying practice-based methods. By pursuing my double master’s degree, I have broadened my skillset in designing mechanisms, making models and analysing data of dynamic (robotic) systems. I aim to improve my knowledge output and designs by identifying suitable methods from both design and engineering.</p>
					<p>In the design process, I often position myself as the ‘mediator’. I am a good listener, adapt well to different group dynamics and seek nuances and overlap in different perspectives. The latter characteristic, together with the desire to expand my technical skillset, drove my decision to pursue a double master’s degree in ID and ME. The interdisciplinary course, that introduced me to soft robotics, showed me that embracing a broad range of perspectives supports the development of novel technologies. However, I experienced first hand that the difference in language, knowledge and skillset can also be a drawback in communication and effective collaboration. By learning the language, skills and knowledge from both fields, I aim to be a ‘mediator’ that supports communication and collaboration. Through my extracurricular activities in curating expositions, I learned the importance of out-reach to other creators and providing a platform to display their (design) projects. My aim is to do this through active involvement within the design and soft robotics community, identifying relevant stakeholders and providing a platform to address stakeholders needs and for collaborations to emerge.</p>
