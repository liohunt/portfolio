					<h5 class="mb-2">Technology & Realization (T&R)</h5>
					<p>At the start of my master ID, I wanted to obtain a strong technical skillset to improve the experience of my demonstrators by integrating appropriate mechanisms and/or algorithms. </p>
					<p>By following courses from interdisciplinary courses and by pursuing the double degree, I gained a broad set of technical skills and knowledge. I can understand the language used within ME and apply appropriate methods for the design of feasible prototypes. Within the developed technical skills and methods, I focussed on the topics of dynamic system design and control. I learned about <a href="multirobotcoordination.html">synchronization of systems and control of multiple robots</a>. Furthermore, I followed courses on additive manufacturing and microfabrication methods. The combination of knowledge on fabrication methods and system design helped me with the design of <a href="master-research-project.html">my first soft robot demonstrator for my M1.2 research project</a>. During my <a href="me-internship-project.html">internship</a>, I learned about combining principles from mechanics and hydraulics to design nature-inspired (soft) robotic systems.</p>
					<p>Overall, the courses and projects helped me to gain a strong technical skillset in fabrication, system design and allowed me to improve my design skills for interactive, soft robotic demonstrators.</p>

					<h5 class="mb-2">Creativity & Aesthetics (C&A)</h5>
					<p>Being able to design meaningful, interactive, tangible designs is core in my development as a designer. During my master, I expanded my skills in material design and practice-based methods. Furthermore, I gained experience in designing with a broad range of (interactive) materials. </p>
					<p>During the ‘Interactive Materiality course’, I expanded my knowledge on literature regarding material (oriented) design methods, explored elasticity of materials and got introduced to using annotations as a reflection method to structure and identify interesting findings in explorations. In <a href="sensai.html">the course ‘Creativity & Aesthetics of data & AI’</a>, I learned concepts and frameworks on ‘Material Aesthetics’ , ‘New Aesthetics’ and ‘Aesthetics of Intelligence’ that address the value in data-informed embodied interaction. With this in mind, we explored how a shape-changing, interactive sculpture could convey or learn from human emotions through touch. From the interdisciplinary course, learned about soft robotics, <a href="lcf-project.html">responsive materials such as liquid crystal fibers (LCF)</a> and how their aesthetics and functionality are inspired by natural systems. I got to explore shape-changing possibilities with the LCF’s and potential applications in wearables. Lastly, <a href="master-research-project.html">in my M1.2</a> I got to use of combination of the previously mentioned methods and skills towards proposing a prototyping approach to explore aesthetics in soft robots. I used the ‘Aesthetics of Intelligence’ framework and annotations to reflect on the design process. </p>

					<h5 class="mb-2">User & Society (U&S)</h5>
					<p>During the first semester of my master ID, I followed the ‘Constructive Design Research’ course where our group performed both quantitative user tests and qualitative expert interviews to validate our evaluation tool in a Lab setting. Furthermore, for the master group project (M1.1), our group employed a user-centred, design thinking approach where quantitative and qualitative user testing methods were employed, persona’s were created and expert interviews were held. </p>
					<p>Later in my masters, I gravitated more towards practice-based methods and the development of dynamic (system) design, moving away from the earlier user-centred approaches. I needed to rethink who my users are and which methods to employ to validate my work. This shift made me focus on identifying and connecting with relevant stakeholders/experts. Furthermore, I employed qualitative data analysing methods for expert validation and feedback on my work. </p>
					<p>Furthermore, by being able to display my own work at expositions, it validated the societal relevance of my projects and relation to current research trends. By <a href="ggo-motf.html">curating an exposition myself</a>, I became aware of trends in technological development rooted in sustainable futures.</p>

					<h5 class="mb-2">Business and Entrepreneurship (B&E)</h5>
					<p>During the earlier years of my masters, I applied B&E related methods to my projects that relate to market value and feasibility of the developed designs. In the master group project (M1.1), our group employed the value proposition canvas and customer journey mapping to investigate the product lifecycle and market value. Furthermore, in the courses ‘Additive and Advanced Manufacturing’ and ‘Microfabrication’, we were given case studies to develop products for companies where we had to motivate our manufacturing techniques used and perform cost analysis.</p>
					<p>Later in my masters, I focused more on my development in relation to networking skills, project communication and outreach within research and industry. I exhibited my work at expositions and symposia which broadened my network within the ‘material design’ and ‘soft robotics community’. By <a href="ggo-motf.html">curating the exposition ‘Museum of the Future’</a> and joining <a href="ggo-cotf.html">the ‘Chair of the Future’ project</a>, I improved my networking skills and created platforms to communicate relevant trends and developments towards sustainable futures both within TU/e and industry. Furthermore, by doing <a href="me-internship-project.html">my internship at research institute AMOLF</a>, I solidified a sustainable network within the soft robotics community and was able to present my work at symposia. I believe that skills that lead to active involvement and collaboration with stakeholders is what supports the relevance of my research and leads to valuable collaborations.</p>

					<h5 class="mb-2">Math, Data & Computing (MD&C)</h5>
					<p>The desire to develop my technical skills and knowledge to improve my demonstrators expands also to the development within MD&C. I improved my programming skills by learning to use languages and programs such as MATLAB, Simulink, C++ and Python. I learned to <a href="multirobotcoordination.html">simulate and model dynamic systems</a> and compare the simulations with experimental results to get the desired performance, such as the control of coordinating multiple robots. Furthermore, I gained experience with different experimental setups, identification of relevant parameters through data analysis and the selection appropriate models <a href="me-internship-project.html">during my internship</a>. During the <a href="sensai.html">'Creativity & Aesthetics of data & AI’ course</a>‘, I used generative AI to translate sensory data from dynamic touch to actuation output of an interactive wall sculpture. This was my first step into the topic of how intelligence can be embodied and dynamically designed, which I later returned to in my soft robotics projects.</p>
					<p>These skills and knowledge allow me to apply appropriate tools and data analysis methods in design and engineering projects and solidified my expertise within the field of engineering.</p>
