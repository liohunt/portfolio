					<!-- <h3 class="mb-4">Summary Project</h3> -->
					<p>After a 4.5-year long journey, from starting my Industrial Design Master (1 year), to trying out the Pre-Master Mechanical Engineering (1 year) and finally doing a double master’s degree (2.5 year), it is time to take a good break. First, I will be travelling to Japan and China for 6-weeks long and hope to fully emerge myself in the culture there and enjoy my rest. After this, I hope to continue in the field of soft robotics or do something with dynamic material and/or system design. Potentially this might be in academia with my current supervisor from ME or with another (research) institute or company. Furthermore, the curation of expositions and collaborating with a broad variety of creators gave me a lot of gratification. Talking with an employee within NEMO, they are setting up pilot projects to explore collaboration with other institutes. This might be something to pursue. But of course, who knows, 4 years ago I did not expect to go on this double degree journey. And I am glad to be so bold to make that decision and hope to embrace that boldness and confidence more in my future endeavours.</p>
