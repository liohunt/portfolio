					<h3 class="mb-4">Embodiment in Control | Summary Project</h3>
					<p>This Final Master Project investigates the development of physical components for a soft body and the implementation of these components into an interactive design research tool. </p>
					<p>First, a coupled oscillator network is developed to address the challenge of controlling actuation patterns in soft robots and how synchronization between two soft limbs can be established. The tool allows for a variety of synchronized actuation patterns to emerge and hereby contributes to new knowledge on how to establish these synchronizations and shows the potential of use for control of other soft robots. </p>
					<p>Second, evaluations show that the tool allows for explorations in interaction and potential in supporting collaborations between designers and engineers. It hereby contributes toward the vision of close collaborations to drive innovative research in this field.</p>

					<h3 class="mb-4">Reflection on Development</h3>
					<p>When I started my Final Master Project (FMP), I finished my ID courses and projects a year prior and done a full year of only ME courses and internship. It took me a while to get back into the designer mindset and get familiar again with methods that were once so natural to me, as I had been learning the ways of mechanical engineering for a full year. It gave me a reality check that comes from the process of becoming the ‘mediator’ that I would like to be. It sometimes feels a bit lonely in between two fields and self-doubt of my abilities kicks in. Luckily, I have a great support system and in previous years worked on creating a sustainable network around me of supervisors, colleagues, friends and soft robotic enthusiasts that supported and collaborated with me on a FMP that I am proud of. This taught me that active involvement in both communities and outreach is essential in understanding and maintaining the language of both fields.</p>
					<p>In my project, I have shown the value of combining experimental data analysis, practice-based methods and qualitative thematic analysis to validate and generate research outcomes that are relevant for both engineering and design. However, the development of one of the components took much longer than initially expected, which led the first part of the project to focus more on the engineering aspects and the second part more on the design aspects. I got to experience firsthand the tension between design and engineering, where the envisioned exploration of intelligence and/or rich interactions by designers are often limited by advancements in fabrication or technical understanding of dynamic system design. However, where it would not have been necessary for me to design the tool from an engineering perspective, it proved to be crucial in understanding and tinkering the system to eventually get it fully synchronized. It also improved the communication of the concept to experts. Through this project, I have identified opportunities and potential pitfalls between design and engineering which allows me to better estimate these hurdles and select appropriate methods in future projects.</p>
					<p>Last, the reflections from the previous paragraphs solidified my strong belief of interdisciplinary collaboration in my vision and identity. From my past projects, I already saw the value of collaborations towards sustainable futures. This was further validated during my FMP through my collaboration with research institute AMOLF, connecting with experts form the soft robotic community at symposia and interviewing experts for my project from industry, academia and the arts. We are all inspired by the natural world around us. This became also one of the core elements of my vision, as I believe this to be the common denominator that drives exciting and valuable research.</p>
